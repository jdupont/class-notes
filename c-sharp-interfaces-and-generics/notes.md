# [C#: Interfaces and Generics](https://www.lynda.com/C-tutorials/Welcome/388134/435136-4.html)

## Interfaces

+ Describe behavior/contract
+ Multiple implementation with interfaces
  + Not a big deal unless interfaces share method signatures
  + Explicit interface implementation helps with that scenario:
    + Prepend interface name to implementation
    + Compiler will use compile-time type to select method
+ `is` and `as` are useful for working with interfaces 
+ Can also have properties in interfaces

## Generics

+ Introduced in C# 2.0
+ Motivation:
  + Type safety
  + Code reusability
  + Performance (compared to boxing/unboxing)
+ Often seen in collections

## Takeaways

+ Course was a good overview of interfaces and generics but didn't teach me many new things
+ Still need to continue working through C# courses
