## Terminology

+ **Sprint**: A small chunk of work from a larger project
+ **Lifecycle**: The stages the project goes through from beginning to end:
  + **Envision**: Determine what it is you're trying to build. Get team together.
  + **Speculate**: Create and estimate feature delivery plan for this sprint
  + **Explore**: Develop the features for this sprint.
  + **Adapt**: Reflect on the results of this sprint (emphasize quick feedback).
  + **Close**: End of project. Deliverables done.
+ **Feature**: A small, contained function that provides business value to a  client.
+ **Stand-up meeting**: Daily touching base between team members. What you achieved already, what you will do
today, and what you need help with.
+ **Project manager**: Responsible for enhancing productivity of each team member by removing distractions and roadblocks.
+ **Velocity**: How many features are being completed in a given sprint.
+ **Burndown Chart**: Communicates how much work still needs to be completed in an Agile project.
+ **Retrospective**: Look back over the sprint or project and see what you've learned (what was accomplished, what was
not accomplished, what changed, etc).
+ **Snowplowing**: Unimplemented features that end up on the backlog list at the end of the sprint.

## Fundamentals

+ Project management process in which larger projects are split into small chunks of work
+ Most valuable in a couple of situations:
  + Need intermediate products to get value
  + Requirements are constantly changing
+ That's why this is great for programming:
  + Intermediate features give value
  + Requirements change all the time
+ Characteristics of Agile Projects
  + Sprints from 2 to 6 weeks
  + Face to face communication
  + Co-located teams
  + Requirement changes are anticipated and accomodated
  + Very short feedback loop and rapid adjustments when feedback is received.

## Envision Stage

+ Project selection is crucial:
  + Need to deliver quality product quickly, but not all at once
  + Requirements will probably change
+ If project doesn't meet these criteria, it might not be a good fit for Agile.
+ Set scope and constraints
+ Determine sprint structure

## Speculate Stage

+ Gather requirements
  + Based on current business needs
  + Usually done by a business analyst or product owner
  + Use case or user story
+ Daily Stand-up Meetings
  + Standing keeps the length short
  + Each team member provides update:
    + What you've accomplished
    + What you will accomplish
    + What roadblocks you face
  + Do not resolve issues during stand-ups
+ Less Frequent Cross-Functional Meetings
  + Other stakeholders
  + Keep everyone relevant in the loop

## Explore Stage

+ Project manager does not control direction of project
+ Project manager clears roadblocks and obstacles to progress
+ Ensure construction is collaborative
  + Collaboration and communication are essential to Agile
  + Need to take special steps is team is not co-located

## Adapt and Close Stages

+ Retrospective
  + See what happened during the sprint, both good and bad
  + Determine what you learned from the sprint
  + Collect ideas from the team
+ Make sure you adapt to evolving business needs
+ Close the project by determing what you've learned

## Takeaways

+ Just an introduction; still more to learn
+ Probably won't gain a thorough understanding until I've participated in a significant team in the real-world
