# [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)

Offered by Google Developer Training.

While taking an introductory course on machine learning, I realized that I might need a bit more knowledge
on the theory of machine learning to get as much value from TensorFlow as possible.

This course is an internal 
Google training made available to the public recently (in the past three months). It provides an 
introduction to the fundamentals of machine learning, so I think it should be pretty appropriate for what
I want to do.
