# [Building and Deploying Deep Learning Applications with TensorFlow](https://www.lynda.com/Google-TensorFlow-tutorials/Building-Deploying-Applications-TensorFlow/601800-2.html)

## Overview

+ TensorFlow is a software framework for building and deploying machine learning models.
+ Typically used to build deep neural networks
+ Comparable alternatives:
  + Theano
  + Torch
  + PyTorch
+ Wrappers for TensorFlow:
  + TensorFlow is very low-level
  + Wrappers exist to up the level of abstraction
  + Keras: a high-level TensorFlow wrapper for building neural networks with only a few lines of code
+ What's with the name:
  + Data is stored in multi-dimensional arrays called tensors
  + Data flows through system
  + So, TensorFlow
+ GPU acceleration can take training times from days to minutes
+ __Supervised Learning__: training from labeled training data
  + Step 1: Choose a model
  + Step 2: Training data
  + Step 3: Testing phase
