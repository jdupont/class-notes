## C# Questions

+ Reference vs Value
  + What's a **reference type**?
    + Reference type stores a reference to the actual data
    + Examples of reference types are classes, interfaces, delegates, objects, and strings.
  + What's a **value type**?
    + Value types actually hold values
    + Examples include `enum`, `bool`s, other primitive types
+ What's an **interface**?
  + Contract: specifies methods of a class
  + No implementation
+ What's an **abstract class**?
  + Class that can't be instantiated
  + Signficant differences from interfaces (worth comparing)
+ What's a **static class**?
  + Unit of organization for methods not associated with particular objecs
  + Can't be instantiated or extended
+ What are **generics**?
  + Ability to specify type as a parameter
  + Improves type checking, code reuse, etc

## Object-Oriented Questions

+ What's **polymorphism**?
  + Presenting the same interface for different underlying forms
  + For example, `Animal` class being extended to `Dog` and `Cat`. Same interface, different behavior.
+ What's **encapsulation**?
  + 
+ What's **abstraction**?
