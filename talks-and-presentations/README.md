# Talks & Presentations

Some of the software content I watch doesn't fit into the class or training category. For example, podcasts and 
talks at conferences don't lend themselves well to the notetaking I usually do for classes.

But, I'd still like to keep track of what I'm watching and the main ideas of each talk, so I'll do that here.

## Career Development

+ [Common Pitfalls of Junior Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYOx8mA5p2c)
    + _Speaker_: Rachel Warbelow
    + _Watched_: 3/17/2018
    + Short talk about some of the common problems faced by junior developers. Mostly targeted towards potential
    mentors and teachers, not towards junior developers themselves.

## DevOps

+ [How Netflix Thinks About DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmM4V33ReCw)
    + _Speaker_: Dave Hahn
    + _Watched_: 3/15/2018
    + Describes how Netflix relies on company culture and personal ownership of code to keep everything inside 
    Netflix working smoothly (as opposed to creating a bunch of specific DevOps processes and procedures). Also
    had some interesting numbers about Netflix as a company.
+ [What can programmers learn from pilots?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we4G_X91e5w)
    + _Speaker_: Andrew Godwin
    + _Watched_: 3/15/2018
    + Describes how aviation has managed to make flying very safe when compared to the inherent dangers of being in
    the air. Very interesting points about concepts like excessive errors and warnings (which ultimately get
    ignored), the importance of checklists and process, and the importance of performing post-mortem investigations
    and analysis when things go wrong.

## Numerical Computing

+ [Numerical Tools for Non-Experts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/numerical-tools-for-non-experts/)
    + _Speaker_: Pavel Panchekha
    + _Watched_: 3/12/2018
    + Describes a couple of cool tools for finding problems in floating point computations. It's easy to inadvertently 
    introduce defects in numerical by introducing innacuracy with floating points (e.g., underflow, loss of precision,
    etc). Pavel Panchekha presents one tool that compares floating point operations in compiled code (assembly) with the
    same computation executed with arbitrary precision arithmetic; if the results diverge, there has been a 
    floating point problem. Then Panchekha presents a second tool that can refactor the mathematical expression
    underlying the floating point operations to eliminate or mitigate the source of error. Cool!

## The Future of Computing

+ [The Birth & Death of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript)
    + _Speaker_: Gary Bernhardt
    + _Watched_: 3/18/2018
    + Excellent talk. The premise is that the talk happens in the year 2035 and consists of the speaker recounting the
    history of computing from 1995 to 2035. So, the talk starts off with a brief history of JavaScript, and then 
    describes how Web Assembly and asm completely revolutionize how programming works. Very interesting talk -- I highly
    recommend it.
